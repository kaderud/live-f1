High Priority:

 * Identify a way of noticing when we haven't got the right decryption
   and bailing out -- instead of displaying junk.

 * Replace numeric parsing code with something a little less primitive
   and more robust.

 * Make sure we handle an event starting while we're running
   correctly; and don't end up displaying garbage.

 * Less evil config-file code.

 * Less evil "get user's registration details" code.

 * Registration within the client.

 * Character set conversion for notices and such, so we display Â®
   instead of the block in the "no timing yet" message.

 * Proper state structures, and callbacks; rather than the intertwined
   mess we have at the moment.

 * Manual Page.


Wishlists:

 * Record/playback functionality for events that your TV provider
   doesn't transmit live -- pause, fast forward and rewind within the
   client too.  (Live Pause? :p)

 * Do SOMETHING with the weather data, and position history data, just
   displaying the current values isn't interesting; it's the trends
   that matter.

 * Keep the history of all the results for each driver, now we have a
   pretty good idea what they all mean; allow the user to cursor to a
   driver on the board and use PgUp/PgDn to scroll through the
   history.

 * Find somewhere to put the commentary.

 * GTK+ ui?
