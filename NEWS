0.2.10 2010-05-11

	* New Maintainer: Dave Pusey <dave@puseyuk.co.uk>

	* Corrected Practice and Qualifying "Laps" column to "Lap", as it displays
	the lap number the car is currently on, not the number of laps completed.
	This can be seen when a car leaves the pit lane on its installation lap, as
	the column immediately changes to 1, indicating the first lap for that car.

	display all 24 cars.
